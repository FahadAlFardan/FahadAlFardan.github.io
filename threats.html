				<h3>Threats</h3>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, the wonderful gentle giants known as Elephants face several different threats and dangers which have sadly led to these wonderful beasts being classified as endangered.<br><br> The largest threat posed to elephants is the illegal international ivory trade which has been banned since 1989. Every year, tens of thousands of elephants are killed by poachers which are after their tusks, an estimated 100 elephants are killed by poachers every single day. Not only are elephant populations suffering from this through population numbers but they are suffering the effects of this through physical evolution as well. Due to the fact that the large tuskers are being targeted, elephant are evolving into having extremely small tusks, this is because the large tuskers are not there to reproduce.<br> <br>
                    Another major threat which elephants face is habitat loss. With human population growth and agricultural fields being in need of more space, humans are destroying territories which elephants thrived in.<br><br>
                    With habitat loss comes another problem, human conflicts. Due to habitats being destroyed, elephants often come into conflicts with people by wandering into their villages or worst, eating a farm crop. These conflicts can results in the deaths of both people and elephants.
